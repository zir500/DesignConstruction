3rd Year Design and Construction - Firmware for a Digital Multimeter.


This is the firmware part of a design and construction module.  The assignment was to design and prototype a digital multimeter which met a specification for accuracy and types of measurement it could make.  

The majority of this project was done in a pair-programming which is why no commits are from this account.
